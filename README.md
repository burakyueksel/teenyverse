# teenyverse
This is probably the smallest universe you can get.

Heavily WIP.

I have been developing another physics simulation [here](https://github.com/burakyueksel/physics) using C.
Let us see which one will prevail, or maybe they merge.

To run the code:

```console
cmake .
make
./PhysicsSimulation
```

A clean rule is implemented for your convenience. If you like to remove the binaries from the previous build (it will work only if you had a build before, meaning you have a generated Makefile), simply run

```console
make clean_files
```


# Mortuis nihil nisi bonum

The Teenyverse was created by [Kyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7L6SSxIvms), a scientist unknowingly inside a Miniverse, in order to create a new source of electricity for his people. He had yet to speed up the universe's time to the point where the inhabitants could create electricity when he showcased it to Rick, Morty, and Zeep Xanflorp. When realizing he himself lived in a tiny artificial universe, he drove his ship into a cliff and died, leaving his guests to fend for themselves.

Rick and Zeep spent months building machines to kill each other; Morty had left early on after growing tired of their fights. Morty met the Tree People and somehow became their leader. After living with them for some months, he ordered the Tree People to take Rick and Zeep back to their home while forcing the two scientists to work together. It was destroyed by Rick when he destroyed the Miniverse created by Zeep.
